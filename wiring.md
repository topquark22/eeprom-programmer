## EEPROM connection

Install two sockets: a 24-pin socket for programming the AT28C16, and a 28-pin socket for the AT28C64 and AT28C256.

Only program one EEPROM at a time.

 We can use the same socket for both the AT28C64 and AT28C256. The wiring differences are minor (see **Note 1** below.)

The following applies to PDIP package. All have the same width of 600 mils (6 * 2.54 mm).

| EEPROM part | pin count | address bus line count | storage capacity (octets) |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [AT28C16](/doc/AT28C16.pdf) | 24       | 11 | 2048 |
| [AT28C64](/doc/AT28C64.pdf) | 28      | 13  | 8192 |
| [AT28C256](/doc/AT28C256.pdf) | 28    | 15  | 32768 |

EEPROM pin label is the reference in the datasheet.

There are two Shift Registers (74HC595), SR1 and SR2. (In the schematic they are called U2 and U3)

D*n* are Arduino pins.

**Note 1:** Our design shares a 28-pin socket for an AT28C64 or an AT28C256 to be programmed. On the AT28C64, pin 1 is an open-drain output (READY/BUSY_) that we do not use. On the AT28C256, pin 1 is an input (A14). In this situation, we need to prevent the possibility of a dead short when using the AT28C64. Although SR2 6 is normally low in its address range, it is prudent to place a 4.7K current-limiting resistor between SR2 pin 6 and the socket pin 1.

**Note 2:** Pin 26 of the shared socket is internally non-connected on the AT28C64. We connect it anyways, although it is recommended to leave it unconnected.
